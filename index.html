									<h2>Experiences</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I enjoy problem solving, as it brings tangible solutions to the real world. Currently, I am looking to explore more about front-end developing because I am interested in enhancing user visual experiences and bring more convenience to their internet adventures. Aside from front-end developing, I am also enthusiast about Machine Learning. During the remaining times of my undergraduate years, I plan on taking more Data Science and Artificial Intelligence classes to better prepare me for robust jobs in the future.

									<h3>Cooking at Home</h3>
									<p>Cooking is very therapeutic and stress-reliefing for me. From buying fresh groceries to plating and serving hot dishes on the table, I enjoy every step of the process. What I like about cooking the most is that I get to customize everything. I mainly use recipes as guides and add my own twist based on my preferences. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@babishculinaryuniverse">This</a> is the Youtube channel I watch the most for inspirations.</p>
									<p>Here are some dishes I made for me and my friends:</p>

									<h3>Favorite Restuarants in NYC</h3>
									<p>New York offers a wide variety of food choices and that's what I love about it. My favorite cuisines include Japanese, Korean, and Mexican. Here is a list of my top five restuarants in New York:</p>

										<li><a href="https://sakamai.com/">Sakamai</a></li>
										<li><a href="http://www.hernameishan.com/">Her name is Han</a></li>

									<h3>Books I've been reading!</h3>
									<p>Recently, I have been getting in the habit of reading. It is important to wind down and spend time by myself every night before bed. I try to take at least one hour out of my day to read a bit. Below are some books I want to share:</p>

										<div class="columns">

										</div>
										<div class="columns">
											<li>This is a book about how an American-Born-Korean Artist found her roots after the passing of her mother due to cancer.</li>
											<li> A very heartfelt but somewhat somber book.</li>
											<li>Connects back to traditional korean dishes to bring special memories to us. It is a good way to savor these good times through good food</li>
											<li>Lesson I learned: Family always comes first. You never realized how important it is until you lose them.</li>
											<li>Speaking of so, I kind of miss home food right now.</li>
											<li>Strongly recommend.</li>

										<div class="columns">
											<li>A very basic book that I think everyone has read (or at least heard of).</li>
											<li>Honestly, I feel like the book was stating the obvious.</li>
											<li>Funny book though.</li>
											<li>A very "light" book, so not a lot of commitment to read it.</li>
											<li>A took some notes while reading it, but I don't really remember any essential take-aways. Might go back to read my notes if I ever need some wise words.</li>

											<li>Read this during quarantine when I got COVID at the end of 2021.</li>
											<li>Pretty self-explanatory.</li>
											<li>I don't have much to say about it, but I think it did help me review some python concepts I was not strong about.</li>

											<li>This was a gift from my friend when I was taking the course Linear Algebra.</li>
											<li>Personally, I find it troubling to learn math from a textbook. I prefer watching videos on it.</li>
											<li>The MIT professor, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL49CF3715CB9EF31D">Gilbert Strang</a>, is a great way I found to learn Linear Algebra.</li>

											<li>Another book that I plan on reading soon.</li>
											<li style="text-decoration: underline">Side note to myself: I should stop buying books because I have too many books I need to read.</li>
											<li>The speed of me buying books is way faster than the speed I read.</li>
											<li>This is a self-help book that I found online. It's pretty thin so I think I can finish it in a few days.</li>
